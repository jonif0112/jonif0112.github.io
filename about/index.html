	<h2>About</h2>
	


	<p>Jon Bella was born in Los Angeles but grew up in the DC area. Initially interested in fashion design as a teen, Bella studied English and philosophy at the univerities of Keele, St Andrews and Stirling.</p>
		
	<p>In her depictions of the human form, test person transcends the boundaries of both classical figuration and modern abstraction. Oil paint, applied in heavy layers, becomes as visceral as flesh itself, each painted mark maintaining a supple, mobile life of its own. As test pushes, smears, and scrapes the pigment over her large-scale canvases, the distinctions between living, breathing bodies and their painted representations begin to collapse.</p>
