	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>In my teens, I stumbled upon a Bacon interview in which he said something that has stuck with me: “[A]ll art has now become[ ] completely a game by which man distracts himself. [I]t is going to become much more difficult for the artist because he must really deepen the game to be any good at all and return the onlooker to life more violently.”
―Jon Bella</p>
		
	<p>In her depictions of the human form, test preson transcends the boundaries of both classical figuration and modern abstraction. Oil paint, applied in heavy layers, becomes as visceral as flesh itself, each painted mark maintaining a supple, mobile life of its own. As test pushes, smears, and scrapes the pigment over her large-scale canvases, the distinctions between living, breathing bodies and their painted representations begin to collapse.</p>

	<p>Bella was born in Los Angeles, California, but grew up in Northern Virginia. Bella studied at the University of Keele in England and then at the University of St Andrews in Scotland.</p>
